</div>

#### On the Midjourney Official Server

Select any `newbies-#` channel visible in the left sidebar.

#### On Other Servers

You can generate images with the Midjourney Bot on any server that has invited the Bot. Look for instructions on your server on where to use the Bot.

### **3:**‚ÄâUse the /imagine Command <a href="#3-use-the-imagine-command" id="3-use-the-imagine-command"></a>

#### About Discord Commands

Interact with the Midjourney Bot on Discord using a Command. Commands are used to create images, change default settings, monitor user info, and perform other helpful tasks.

The `/imagine` command generates a unique image from a short text description (known as a Prompt).

#### Using /imagine

1. Type `/imagine prompt:` or select the `/imagine` command from the slash commands pop-up.
2. Type a description of the image you want to create in the \`prompt\` field.
3. Click return to send your message.
4. The Midjourney Bot will generate a pop-up asking you to accept the Terms of Service. You must agree to the Terms of Service before any image will be generated.

Respect the Community Guidelines. Community guidelines apply wherever the Midjourney Bot is used.

If you don't see a pop-up when typing the `/imagine` command, try logging out, updating the Discord app, and logging back in.

Commands only work in bot Channels. Commands will not work in regular channels like #trial-support.

### **4:**‚ÄâProcesses the Job <a href="#4-processes-the-job" id="4-processes-the-job"></a>

#### The Midjourney Bot takes about a minute to generate four options.

![Image of the Midjourney Discord button interface after generating a grid of images](https://cdn.document360.io/3040c2b6-fead-4744-a3a9-d56d621c6c7e/Images/Documentation/MJ\_ImageGrid\_Generation.gif)

Generating an image activates the free Midjourney trial.Trial users can make roughly 25 Jobs before needing to subscribe.

A Job is any action that uses the Midjourney Bot. Jobs include using the `/imagine` command to create a grid of images, upscaling images, or creating image variations, all use your free trial time.

Use the `/info` command to check your Fast Time Remaining to see your remaining Trial time.

### **5:**‚ÄâUpscale or Create Variations <a href="#5-upscale-or-create-variations" id="5-upscale-or-create-variations"></a>

#### After the initial image grid has finished generating, two rows of buttons appear:

![Image of the Midjourney Discord button interface after generating a grid of images](https://cdn.document360.io/3040c2b6-fead-4744-a3a9-d56d621c6c7e/Images/Documentation/MJ\_Interface\_UX.png)

`U1` `U2` `U3` `U4`

U buttons upscale an image generating a larger version of the selected image and adding more details.

`V1` `V2` `V3` `V4`

V buttons create slight variations of the selected grid image. Creating a variation generates a new image grid similar to the chosen image's overall style and composition.

`üîÑ`

The üîÑ (re-roll) reruns a Job. In this case it would rerun the original prompt producing a new grid of images.

\


### **6:**‚ÄâRate Images <a href="#6-rate-images" id="6-rate-images"></a>

#### After using upscaling an image a new set of options will appear:

`ü™Ñ Make Variations` `üîç Light Upscale Redo` `üîç Beta Upscale Redo` `‚ÜóÔ∏èWeb`

**Make Variations:** creates a variation of the upscaled image and generates a new grid of four options.

**Beta/Light Upscale Redo:** redo the upscale using a different upscaler model.

**Web:** Open the image in your gallery on [Midjourney.com](https://www.midjourney.com/home/)

`üòñ` `üòí` `üôÇ` `üòç`

Click a smiley button to rate any upscaled image on the [Midjourney website](https://www.midjourney.com/app/ranking/) or in Discord. Each day, the top 1000 image raters receive an hour of free, Fast Mode time. Rank your work or the work of others. Rank based on your personal style and opinion. Love the look, effort, colors, concept, or theme? Please give it a üòç!

### **7:**‚ÄâSave Your Image <a href="#7-save-your-image" id="7-save-your-image"></a>

Click on the image to open it to full size, and then right-click and choose `Save image`. On mobile, long tap the image and then tap the download icon in the top right corner.

All images are immediately available to view on [midjourney.com/app](https://www.midjourney.com/app/)\
`Sign In with Discord` to view.

### **8:**‚ÄâSubscribe to a Plan <a href="#8-subscribe-to-a-plan" id="8-subscribe-to-a-plan"></a>

Trial users have roughly 25 free Jobs. Jobs do not presently expire but will also not renew. To make more images use the `/subscribe` command in any Bot Channel to generate a personal link to the midjourney account page. **Do not share this personal link with others.**

For prices and more information go to Subscription Plans

You can interact with the Midjourney Bot on Discord by typing a Command. Commands are used to create images, change default settings, monitor user info, and perform other helpful tasks.

Midjourney Commands can be used in any Bot Channel, on private Discord servers where the Midjourney Bot has been permitted to operate, or in a direct message with the Midjourney Bot.

A Prompt is a short text phrase that the Midjourney Bot interprets to produce an image. The Midjourney Bot breaks down the words and phrases in a prompt into smaller pieces, called tokens, that can be compared to its training data and then used to generate an image. A well-crafted prompt can help make unique and exciting images.

**Bot Channels** are Discord channels where the Midjourney Bot has been permitted to process Slash Commands. On the official Midjourney Discord, all channels in the **Newcomer Rooms**, **Thread Channels**, **Themed Image Gen**, and **General Image Gen** categories are Bot Channels.
